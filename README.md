In this GitHub directory you will find the code necessary to run analyses and recreate figures from the manuscript "A Characterization of SNPs in the A and B Clades of SARS-CoV-2" by Tyson Dawson and Hui Wen
You will also find tutorials for how to perform:
Machine learning on SNPs to predict clade using multinomial logistic regression (Tyson's Individual Project)
as well as
Point mutation effect prediction on protein structure (Hui's Individual Project)
