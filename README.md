In this GitHub directory you will find the code necessary to run analyses and recreate figures from the manuscript "A Characterization of SNPs in the A and B Clades of SARS-CoV-2" by Tyson Dawson and Hui Wen <br/><br/>
You will also find tutorials for how to perform:<br/><br/>
Machine learning on SNPs to predict clade using multinomial logistic regression (Tyson's Individual Project)<br/><br/>

as well as<br/><br/>
Point mutation effect prediction on protein structure (Hui's Individual Project) <br/><br/>
